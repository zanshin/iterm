# iTerm Extras
I keep the font I like (Hack) and the color scheme I prefer (Neutron) for iTerm here. Makes it
easier to setup iTerm on new instance of macOS.

# Patched Fonts
For patched fonts use:

    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
    brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font

I like the JetBrains Mono Patched Font, which can be found here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts
